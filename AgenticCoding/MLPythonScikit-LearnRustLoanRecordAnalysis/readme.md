### Rust Search Engine

**Basic search commands:**

```bash
# Search by loan ID
./target/release/loan-search search --loan-id LOAN_000001

# Search by status
./target/release/loan-search search --status Active

# Search with amount range
./target/release/loan-search search --min-amount 200000 --max-amount 500000

# Natural language search
./target/release/loan-search search -q "active loans with high interest rates"

# Portfolio statistics
./target/release/loan-search stats
```

**Advanced search examples:**

```bash
# Complex multi-criteria search

```rust
// Fuzzy matching threshold (0.0 - 1.0)
const FUZZY_THRESHOLD: f64 = 0.8;

// Default result limit
const DEFAULT_LIMIT: usize = 10;

// Index refresh interval
const INDEX_REFRESH_MINUTES: u64 = 30;
```
