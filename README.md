======================== Vibe Coding ========================
## Vibe Coding - New Software Development Approach
Vibe coding is a new approach to programming that relies on AI-powered tools to generate code based on natural language prompts. Instead of manually writing every line of code, developers describe what they want, and AI models create the software for them.

How It Works:
- Describe the task – Users provide a prompt, like "Create a function that sorts a list of numbers."
- AI generates the code – The AI writes the function based on the prompt.
- Refinement & testing – Developers review, test, and tweak the AI-generated code.

Benefits:
- Faster development – AI speeds up coding by handling repetitive tasks.
- Lower barrier to entry – Non-programmers can create software without deep coding knowledge.
- Enhanced creativity – Developers focus on ideas rather than syntax.

Challenges:
- Limited control – AI-generated code may contain errors or inefficiencies.
- Security risks – AI might introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully reviewed.

Tools:  
Vibe coding tools are revolutionizing software development by allowing developers to write code using natural language prompts, making coding more intuitive and accessible. Here are some of the top vibe coding tools in 2025:
- Cursor – A leading AI-powered coding assistant that enhances productivity.
- Replit – A cloud-based IDE with AI pair programming capabilities.
- Lovable – Known for its beginner-friendly approach to vibe coding.
- Bolt AI – A powerful tool for rapid prototyping and automation.
- GitHub Copilot – A well-established AI coding assistant for autocompletion.
- Claude Code – An AI-driven coding tool designed for efficiency.
- Windsurf Editor – A free AI-powered IDE supporting over 70 programming languages.

These tools are making coding more efficient, reducing setup time, and enabling developers to focus on creativity rather than syntax.

### Entity Framework Core Integration:
1.	DbContext Interface: Define an interface for the DbContext that inherits from IEfCoreDbContext.
2.	DbContext Class: Inherit the DbContext from AbpDbContext<TDbContext> and implement the corresponding interface.
3.	Table Prefix and Schema: Add static TablePrefix and Schema properties to the DbContext class. Use a short table prefix to create unique table names3.
4.	Model Mapping: Explicitly configure all entities by overriding the OnModelCreating method of the DbContext.

### Module Development:
1.	Remote Service Compatibility: Develop modules that can be used as a remote service or microservice, as well as being compatible with a monolithic application.
2.	Dependency Management: Explicitly declare dependencies for each package/module.
3.	Flexible Usage: Design modules to be used flexibly in different types of applications (monolithic, microservices, remote services).

### Continuous Improvement:
1.	Stay Updated: Keep up with the latest ABP documentation, guides, and best practices.
2.	Community Engagement: Engage with the ABP community for support, feedback, and collaboration.
