## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-ai-loan-analyzer.git
   cd rust-ai-loan-analyzer
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb loans
   
   # Set environment variable
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost/loans"
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and build**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --help
   ```

## üìã Database Schema

The application works with the following loan record schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE loans (
    loan_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    property_address TEXT NOT NULL,
    origination_date DATE NOT NULL,
    maturity_date DATE NOT NULL,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    remaining_balance DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    interest_rate DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL,
    monthly_payment DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    product_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    security_name VARCHAR(100),
    servicer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    current_status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for optimal performance
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_status ON loans(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_product_type ON loans(product_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_servicer ON loans(servicer_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_amount ON loans(loan_amount);
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_origination_date ON loans(origination_date);
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Search Loans with Filters

```bash
# Search by status and amount range
cargo run -- search --status "Current" --min-amount 100000 --max-amount 500000

# Search by product type
cargo run -- search --product-type "Fixed Rate Mortgage"
```

### Generate Portfolio Summary

```bash
# Get comprehensive portfolio analytics
cargo run -- summary
```

### Find Similar Loans

```bash
# Find loans similar to a specific loan ID
cargo run -- similar --loan-id "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" --limit 5
```

## üß† AI Features

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

The application uses a sophisticated risk scoring model that considers:

- **Interest Rate Analysis**: Higher rates indicate increased risk
- **Balance Ratio**: Remaining balance vs. original loan amount
- **Payment History**: Current status and delinquency patterns
- **Loan Age**: Time since origination affects risk profile
- **Market Conditions**: Economic indicators and trends

### Machine Learning Features

- **Clustering Analysis**: Groups similar loans for risk assessment
- **Similarity Matching**: Finds comparable loans using feature vectors
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts loan performance and default probability
- **Automated Categorization**: AI-powered risk category assignment
