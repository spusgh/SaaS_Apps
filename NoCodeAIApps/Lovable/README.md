## State Management
The application uses React Context for global state management:

### CartContext
```typescript
interface CartItem {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  image: string;
  quantity: number;
  specialInstructions?: string;
}

interface CartContextType {
  items: CartItem[];
  addToCart: (item: CartItem) => void;
  removeFromCart: (id: number) => void;
  updateQuantity: (id: number, quantity: number) => void;
  updateSpecialInstructions: (id: number, instructions: string) => void;
  clearCart: () => void;
  cartTotal: number;
  itemCount: number;
}
```

## Routing Structure
```typescript
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
  <Route path="/products" element={<Products />} />
  <Route path="/product/:id" element={<ProductDetail />} />
  <Route path="/cart" element={<Cart />} />
  <Route path="/checkout" element={<Checkout />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>
```

## Data Flow
1. Products are loaded from static data in `data/products.ts`
2. Cart operations are handled through CartContext
3. User interactions trigger state updates
4. Changes persist to localStorage where appropriate
5. Form submissions trigger validation before processing

## Styling Guidelines
- Uses Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Custom color palette:
  - Primary: pastry-200 to pastry-800
  - Secondary: bakery-100 to bakery-900
  - Accent: crust
- Responsive breakpoints:
  - sm: 640px
  - md: 768px
  - lg: 1024px
  - xl: 1280px

## Performance Considerations
- Image optimization for product photos
- Cart state persistence in localStorage
- Lazy loading of route components
- Debounced form inputs
- Memoized component renders where appropriate

## Future Enhancements

   - User authentication
   - Order history
   - Product management
2. Payment Processing
   - Stripe integration
   - Multiple payment methods
3. Advanced Features

2. Styling
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes
   - Maintain consistent spacing
   - Follow responsive design patterns
3. State Management
