# 🌐 LangChain Ecosystem Overview

LangChain is a modular framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes **composability**, **observability**, and **agentic workflows**, enabling developers to create intelligent, context-aware systems with ease.

## 📦 Core Packages

### `langchain-core`
- **Purpose**: Base abstractions for LLMs, tools, memory, vector stores, and chains
- **Features**:
  - LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for chaining components
  - Runnables with support for streaming, async, batch, and fallback logic
  - Lightweight and integration-agnostic

### `langchain`
- **Purpose**: High-level chains, agents, and retrieval strategies
- **Features**:
  - Cognitive architecture for LLM apps
  - Prebuilt chains and agent templates
  - Generic across integrations

### `langchain-community`
- **Purpose**: Third-party integrations maintained by the community
- **Features**:
  - Connectors for LLMs, vector DBs, tools, and document loaders
  - Optional dependencies for lightweight installs

## 🧠 Key Extensions

### `LangGraph`
- **Purpose**: Graph-based orchestration for multi-agent workflows
- **Features**:
  - Nodes, edges, and stateful flows
  - Supports cyclic reasoning and collaborative agents
  - Ideal for research assistants, task automation, and decision systems

### `LangServe`
- **Purpose**: Deploy LangChain apps as REST APIs
- **Features**:
  - Production-ready endpoints
  - Supports Runnables and LCEL workflows
  - LangGraph Platform available for advanced deployments

### `LangSmith`
- **Purpose**: Observability and debugging platform
- **Features**:
  - Execution tracing and prompt inspection
  - Performance monitoring and evaluation
  - Seamless integration with LangChain and LangGraph

### `LangFlow`
- **Purpose**: Visual builder for LangChain workflows
- **Features**:
